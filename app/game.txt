## Stage Breakdown

## Extra Tension Mechanics
- Random events mid-stage (alarms, patrols, camera sweeps)
- Optional loot for higher risk/reward
- Vote to extend timer â€” but increases alert level
- Limited-use "Tools" (buy with money from previous runs)

---

## Multiplayer Interaction Ideas
- Voice chat integrated or text with restrictions (like needing line-of-sight or comms puzzles)
- Puzzle dependencies (ex: Safe Cracker needs a code from Hacker mid-puzzle)
- Visual puzzle clues only visible to certain roles
- Panic button to ask for help but with a cooldown

## Visual/Style Ideas
- Clean, blueprint-style UI with heist music  
- Neon cyberpunk bank?  
- Silhouette-style characters with subtle animations
